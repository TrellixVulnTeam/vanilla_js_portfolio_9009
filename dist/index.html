                <p>
                    Passionate about building websites and apps with a variety of technologies,
                    I enjoy designing the visual elements of the front end and the backend inner workings equally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My skillset includes Javascript, ReactJS, VueJS, NodeJS and database technologies including MySQL and PostgreSQL.
                </p>
                <p>Take a look at some of my projects below and don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>

                    <h3>Green Oil</h3>
                    <div class='description'>
                        <p>
                            Custom built e-commerce website based on a sustainable bicycle oil company, using a PayPal payment API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I visited Green Oil's website whilst looking for eco friendly oil for maintaining my bike. 
                            I saw it was in need of a redesign and realised it was a great project to take on to learn more about online payment integration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project gave me a great insight into integrating payment methods, using PayPal on this occasion. I also added the option to toggle between Pounds Sterling and Euros currencies.

                    <div class='description'>
                        <p>
                            Website for vegan animal activism group 'Manchester Animal Climate Action'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Manchester Animal Action were in the process of rebranding to Manchester Animal Climate Action. They were also in need of a website overhaul as their original site has various design issues.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I built this new website using VueJS, basing the initial content on their original site, but improving the layout and responsiveness for different devices and screen sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also made suggestions to improve and add to the site content, such as relevant news, advice and vegan recipes etc. I'm currently working with MACA to finalise content.

                    <div class='description'>
                        <p>
                            Full stack database solution built using ReactJS, NodeJS and Postgresql.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was built to replace an old MS Access database which had been in use since the mid 90s.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Probably my most complex project to date, but also the most enjoyable as I was able to really get to grips with the full capabilities of React.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I initially took a class based approach to building the app, but having learnt how to use React Hooks and Redux I rebuilt the app. This was a great learning experience, reviewing my original code and discovering where it could be improved to improve the functionality and reliability of the app.

                <p>I first discovered my love for programming when I was around ten years old, playing with a BBC MICRO computer. I learned how to print out my name multiple times with a loop and that's all it took to get me hooked. A few years later I taught myself Visual Basic, and from there moved on to tinkering with C++ and Assembly. Of course once I had an internet connection I began learning about HTML. I loved building something from scratch using nothing more than a simple text editor.</p>
                <p>At some point my interest turned to photography, although I always kept my hand in programming and web design, building the occasional website for friends and colleagues. Now, with over ten years working as a clinical photographer in the NHS, I find myself being drawn back to my coding.</p>
                <p>My experience lies primarily in the following technologies:
                <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>ReactJS + Redux</li>
                        <li>VueJS + Vuex</li>
                        <li>NodeJS</li>
                        <li>Postgresql</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Those are my core skills, however the fun for me will always be learning and experimenting, so I never grow tired of acquiring new skills, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://c0llid3r.github.io/snake"><span id="snake">HTML Canvas</span></a>.

                <p>
                    Having trained and worked as a photographer and videographer, I also have extensive experience using creative editing software, in particular Adobe products including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro.
