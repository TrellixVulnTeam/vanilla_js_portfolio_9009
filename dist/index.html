                            I visited Green Oil's website whilst looking for eco friendly oil for maintaining my bike. 
                            I saw it was in need of a redesign and realised it was a great project to take on to learn more about online payment integration.

                        <p>
                            This project gave me a great insight into integrating payment methods, using PayPal on this occasion. I also added the option to toggle between Pounds Sterling and Euros currencies.

                            Manchester Animal Action were in the process of rebranding to Manchester Animal Climate Action. They were also in need of a website overhaul as their original site has various design issues.

                            As the site needs to be easily updated by MACA volunteers, I chose to build it using Wordpress. I created a custom theme so that I could design the site from scratch.

                            I initially took a class based approach to building the app, but having learnt how to use React Hooks and Redux I rebuilt the app. This was a great learning experience, reviewing my original code and discovering where it could be improved to improve the functionality and reliability of the app.

            <h3 id="history"><br><br><br>History</h3>
                <p class='first-para'>My fascination with computers and programming reaches as far back as my very early teens when I inherited a BBC MICRO. I figured out how to fill the screen with my name using a loop and was immediately hooked. Over the next few years I found more to love about computing. The first language I learnt in depth was Visual Basic. Once I had an internet connection I began experimenting with HTML, tweaking existing web pages and building my own with a basic text editor. My interest grew and grew as I learned about other programming languages and the existence of open source Linux operating systems.</p>
                <p>At some point during college I became interested in photography. This led me to quite an abrupt but rewarding decision to switch from a maths and computing course to a focus on photography, achieving a BSc (Hons) in Photography and Media Production. Soon after graduating I began working as a clinical photographer in the NHS.</p>
                <p>Throughout my clinical photography career my interest in web design continued. Over the years I've had the opportunity to build websites for colleagues as well as a number of portfolio sites for my personal photography.</p>
                <p>Now, having spent over ten years as a clinical photographer, I find myself being drawn back to web development with even more enthusiasm than before.</p>
                <h3 id="coding-skills"><br><br><br>Coding Skills</h3>
                <p>My experience lies in the following:
                <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML and CSS/SCSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript (including ES6)</li>
                        <li>PHP</li>
                        <li>Laravel</li>
                        <li>ReactJS + Redux</li>
                        <li>VueJS + Vuex</li>
                        <li>NodeJS</li>
                        <li>Using and building APIs</li>
                        <li>Relational databases including MySQL and PostgreSQL</li>
                        <li>Package managers including NPM and Composer</li>
                        <li>Git and GitHub for version control</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>My first venture back into web development began with learning JavaScript. Once I felt confident with my abilities I moved on to React which was a real eye opener to the possibilities of modern web development. From there I learnt to build similar products using Vue and soon after delved back into PHP and began experimenting with Laravel. The learning never ends and <a target="_blank" href="https://c0llid3r.github.io/snake"><span class='inline-link' id='snake'>never gets dull</span></a>.</p>

                    Having trained and worked as a photographer and videographer, I also have extensive experience using creative editing software. I have been using Adobe products including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro for over ten years. I also have experience with similar software including Inkscape and GIMP.

                <p>I enjoy using Illustrator or Inkscape to create vector graphics for logos and icons, although I feel most comfortable in Photoshop, not surprisingly due to my extensive background in photography.</p>
